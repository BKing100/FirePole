Introducing the newest FiveM script by **BKing Development**: Fire Pole.

 

This script revolutionises your roleplay within your fire stations, allowing you to finally slide down your fire poles for free!

 

# Configuration

We include a very simple configuration file that allows you to get going with your script within minutes, all you need to do is change the coordinates for your pole and you are good to go!

You can change the speed, language, and the distance you need to be to get onto the pole. If you want to change anything else, either do it yourself or get in contact with us via our Discord.

 

# How many? Multiple!

You can add as many poles as you want within this script. You can even add multiple places to get onto one pole, if it spans over multiple floors!
